# AI-Analyst-StartUp-Evaluation
Customizable Weighted Scoring: Investors can adjust risk and growth signal weights (market size, team dynamics, traction, tech defensibility), personalizing recommendations for their strategy.
Challenge
Early-stage investors often drown in unstructured startup data — pitch decks, founder calls, emails, and scattered news reports. Traditional analysis is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing red flags. What’s needed is an AI analyst that can cut through the noise, evaluate startups like a trained associate, and generate investor-ready insights at scale.
Objective
Build an AI-powered analyst that reviews founder material and public data to create concise, actionable deal notes with clear benchmarks and risk assessments across sectors and geographies.
Solution Capabilities:
Ingest pitch decks, call transcripts, founder updates, and emails to generate structured deal notes.
Benchmark startups against sector peers using financial multiples, hiring data, and traction signals.
Flag potential risk indicators like inconsistent metrics, inflated market size, or unusual churn patterns.
Summary growth potential and generate investor-ready recommendations tailored to customizable weightages.
Tech Stack:Use of Google AI technologies (Gemini, Vertex AI, Cloud Vision, BigQuery, Firebase, Agent Builder).
A robust solution to the challenge of startup evaluation for early-stage investors is an AI-powered analyst platform that automatically synthesizes founder materials and public data, generating concise investment insights at scale. This addresses the overwhelming volume and inconsistency of traditional analysis by providing structure, benchmarks, and risk identification using advanced AI models.
Solution Overview
•	The AI analyst ingests unstructured data such as pitch decks, founder updates, call transcripts, and emails, then systematically converts this into well-structured deal notes with clear benchmarks and sector comparisons.
•	Benchmarking leverages financial multiples, hiring patterns, traction signals, and comprehensive industry comps using curated databases and real-time market feeds.
•	Risk assessment combines statistical anomalies (e.g., inflated metrics, market size inconsistencies, or unusual churn) with sector-specific red flags detected via multimodal AI models and natural language processing.
•	Growth potential is scored and summarized using predictive analytics, and recommendations are customized by weighting parameters relevant to the investor's thesis or sector.
